### Hi there 👋

Hello! 🙌 My name is Ahmad Fikri Akbar and Currently, I am a student pursuing a degree in Mathematics Education at Lambung Mangkurat University. Alongside my studies, I have been working on developing my skills in programming. I am an avid self-learner, relying on online resources, particularly YouTube, to enhance my programming abilities.

I am a passionate individual who started learning programming in 2021. I have a particular interest in web development and thoroughly enjoy exploring this field. I am always eager to learn new things and expand my knowledge. Throughout my learning journey, I have successfully completed several real projects. These projects have allowed me to apply my knowledge and showcase my capabilities.
