<h2 align="left">Hi There 👋! </h2>
Hi! My name is Ahmad Fikri Akbar. I hold a degree in Mathematics Education from Lambung Mangkurat University. Currently, I work as a civil servant (ASN) at the Ministry of Religious Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia, specifically in the Directorate of Islamic Education.

Alongside my role as a government employee, I am also actively involved in web development. My journey into programming began in 2021, and since then, I have been continuously honing my skills through self-learning, utilizing various online resources. I have a deep passion for web development and enjoy exploring new technologies in this field.

#### These are my favorite Technology stack that I'm in love with ❤️
- Next JS 🧑‍💻
- React JS ⚛️
- Typescript 😎
- Tailwind CSS 💨
- Node JS 💚
- Laravel 🍎

I share some stuff and projects on my personal website. Checkout [here](https://ninepmx.my.id) 🔥

If you have any questions or would like to engage in a discussion, please feel free to reach me out. I would be delighted to assist you in any way I can.
